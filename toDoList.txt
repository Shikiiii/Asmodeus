Things to do:
change mod commands permissions from **role** to **permission**
change so the name of the server in every mod command displays a **string** with the name of it,instead of a preset string
fix the global messages count
completely recode !lockdown,leaving 2 choices to either lock down every channel or just this channel
make logs optional 
make an option to change the prefix for each guild
make **info** an embed (and a command,with required permissions)
remove useless features
split the code into different files (That's mostly also David's job)
fix an empty string bug on !ship
make it so that !ship can take 1 user only too
fix the restart command and add permissions to it 
serverinfo and userinfo currently require roles,make them public commands
timestamps are formatted wrongly and currently display only gtm+0,change them to discord-style timestamps and make them able to track individual user's timezone
deleted and message logs
detect that the author deleted their own message when someone else forefully deleted it,to be fixed
if the bot does not have perms to change the nickname, there's probably a return somewhere in the code, remove that from afk
we should loop through the string of define and replace spaces with +es
we should add a timer to afk
add a basic economy database to store $ for each user
add a pat and a facepalm command
begin the music stuff
add a way to choose your own welcome message and channel
add a way to choose your own leave message and channel
add APIs that allow to pull results from Wikipedia,Reddit,Facebook and Twitter
remove the stupid limit from purge (seriously, remove it) 
add **!r id** (Facebook-style reply command,reply to Discord messages)
